**Introduction**

This project aims to reproduce the findings presented in the paper titled "Overexpression of VaWRKY14 increases drought tolerance in Arabidopsis by modulating the expression of stress-related genes." The original study investigates the impact of overexpressing the VaWRKY14 gene on drought tolerance in Arabidopsis and explores the associated modulation of stress-related gene expression.

**Background**

Drought stress is a significant environmental factor that poses a threat to crop yields and plant survival. The VaWRKY14 gene, identified in the paper, has been implicated in conferring drought tolerance. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this tolerance is crucial for developing resilient crops and improving agricultural sustainability.

**Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1- **Data Retrieval**: Download and preprocess the RNA-seq data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) as used in the original study.


2- **Data Analysis**: Reproduce the differential expression analysis and statistical procedures outlined in the paper.


3- **Result Validation**: Validate and compare the obtained results with those reported in the original study.


4- **Code Transparency**: Provide a transparent and accessible R script for others to review, understand, and reproduce the analysis.

**Methodology**

The data used in this project were obtained from SRA, and the analysis is conducted using R, leveraging tools such as DESeq2 for differential expression analysis. The goal is to closely follow the methods outlined in the original paper to ensure the validity and accuracy of the results.
