**Introduction**

This project aims to explore the differential expression of genes associated with drought tolerance in Arabidopsis due to the overexpressing of VaWRKY14. 

**Background**

Drought stress is a significant environmental factor that poses a threat to crop yields and plant survival. The VaWRKY14 gene has been implicated in conferring drought tolerance. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying this tolerance is crucial for developing resilient crops and improving agricultural sustainability.  

**Methodology**

The data used in this project were obtained from SRA, and the analysis is conducted using R, leveraging tools such as DESeq2 for differential expression analysis.

**Objectives**

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

- [x] **Data Retrieval**: Download and preprocess the RNA-seq data from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) as used in the original study.


- [x] **Data Analysis**: Perform the differential expression analysis and statistical procedures using DESeq2.


- [x] **Result Visualization**: Visualize the results using the Expression heatmap, Volcano plot, and Expression plot.


- [x] **Code Transparency**: Provide a transparent and accessible R script for others to review, understand, and reproduce the analysis.

**Results**
